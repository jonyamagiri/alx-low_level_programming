## 0x1C. C - Makefiles

> This repository contains the tasks for `C - Makefiles` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Description

**Make** is Unix utility that is designed to start execution of a `makefile`. A makefile is a special file, containing shell commands, that you create and name makefile [or Makefile](http://www.sis.pitt.edu/mbsclass/tutorial/advanced/makefile/whatis.htm).
* Make keeps track of the last time files (normally object files) were updated and only updates those files which are required (ones containing changes) to keep the sourcefile up-to-date. 
* The makefile contains a list of rules. These rules tell the system what commands you want to be executed. Below is the syntax of a typical rule:
```
target: prerequisites
<TAB> recipe
```

In this project, I learnt:
* What are make, Makefiles
* When, why and how to use Makefiles
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them

### Tasks

#### Task: 0-Makefile

#### Task: 1-Makefile

#### Task: 2-Makefile

#### Task: 3-Makefile

#### Task: 4-Makefile

#### Task: 5-island_perimeter.py
**Technical interview prep:** 
Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:
* grid is a list of list of integers:
	* 0 represents a water zone
	* 1 represents a land zone
	* One cell is a square with side length 1
	* Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
	* Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
* Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).

#### Task: 100-Makefile

#### Files:

* []()
