## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This repository contains the tasks for `C - More functions, more nested loops` project and a description of what each program or function does:

#### 0-isupper.c
A function that checks for uppercase character [similar: `man isupper`]
* Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
* Returns `1` if `c` is uppercase
* Returns `0` otherwise

#### 1-isdigit.c
A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). [similar: `man isdigit`]
* Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`
* Returns `1` if `c` is a digit
* Returns `0` otherwise

#### 2-mul.c
A function that multiplies two integers.
* Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b);`

#### 3-print_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_numbers(void);`
* You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code

#### 4-print_most_numbers.c
A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`
* Do not print `2` and `4`
* You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code

#### 5-more_numbers.c
A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`
* You can only use `_putchar` three times in your code

#### 6-print_line.c
A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
* Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
* You can only use `_putchar` function to print
* Where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed
* The line should end with a `\n`
* If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`

#### 7-print_diagonal.c
A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
* Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`
* You can only use `_putchar` function to print
* Where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed
* The diagonal should end with a `\n`
* If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print a `\n`

#### 8-print_square.c
A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_square(int size);`
* You can only use `_putchar` function to print
* Where `size` is the size of the square
* If `size` is `0` or less, the function should print only a new line
* Use the character `#` to print the square

#### 9-fizz_buzz.c
A program that prints the numbers from `1` to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
* Each number or word should be separated by a space
* You are allowed to use the standard library

#### 10-print_triangle.c
A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: `void print_triangle(int size);`
* You can only use `_putchar` function to print
* Where `size` is the size of the triangle
* If `size` is `0` or less, the function should print only a new line
* Use the character `#` to print the triangle

#### 100-prime_factor.c
* Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

#### 101-print_number.c
* Write a function that prints an integer.
