## 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

> This repository contains the tasks for `C - Search Algorithms` project and a description of what each program or function does:

### Learning Objectives

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs


### Tasks

#### Task: 0-linear.c
* Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the [Linear search algorithm](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/17RKhbmvh_u4ebCwaSxCxg)
Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the first index where value is located
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
