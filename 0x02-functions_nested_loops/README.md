This README file contains a description of what each program in the **C - Functions, nested loops** project does:

# 0-putchar.c
Program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. [The program should return 0]

# 1-alphabet.c
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. [Prototype: void print_alphabet(void); You can only use _putchar twice in your code]

# 2-print_alphabet_x10.c
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. [Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void); You can only use _putchar twice in your code]

# 3-islower.c
Write a function that checks for lowercase character. [Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase. Returns 0 otherwise]


# 4-isalpha.c
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character. [Prototype: int _isalpha(int c); Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase. Returns 0 otherwise]
