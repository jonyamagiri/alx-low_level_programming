## 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

> This repository contains the tasks for `C - Bit manipulation` project and a description of what each program or function does:

#### Task: 0-binary_to_uint.c
Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.

#### Task: 1-print_binary.c
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

#### Task: 2-get_bit.c
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

#### Task: 3-set_bit.c
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.

#### Task: 4-clear_bit.c
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.

#### Task: 5-flip_bits.c
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
